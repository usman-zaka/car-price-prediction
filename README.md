# Car Price Prediction 

### About the project:
In this project, I leveraged machine learning and data science techniques to  predict car prices based on key attributes.

#### 🔹 Key steps I worked on:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values and ensured each features had appropriate data types.\
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized data trends and correlations to guide feature selection.\
✅ Model Selection & Evaluation – Trained and tested Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR).\
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning – Fine-tuned the best-performing model (GBR) to optimize accuracy.\
✅ Model Performance Assessment – Evaluated models using R², MSE, RMSE, and MAE and analyzed residual and QQ-plots to ensure robustness.\

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways:
📌 Feature engineering played a major role in model performance.\
📌 MLR had the highest accuracy but didn’t meet all assumptions (QQ-plot & residual analysis).\
📌 GBR provided the best balance between accuracy and reliability, making it the final model choice.\

💡 This project strengthened my data science skills, particularly in predictive modeling, regression analysis, and model evaluation. Excited to apply these skills to real-world challenges!
